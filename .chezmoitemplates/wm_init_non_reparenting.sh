# Initialize features for non-reparenting WMs.

# The standard Java GUI tookit keeps a list of known non-reparenting window
# managers. If using one that is not on that list, the windows might display a
# blank screen. This can be solved by setting the name of the WM to one that is
# known to be non-reparenting.
