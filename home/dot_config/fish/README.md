# Fish Shell

## Package Manager

Install [Fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher) using:

```curl
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jorgebucaran/fisher/main/functions/fisher.fish | source && fisher install jorgebucaran/fisher
```

This assumes that the `fish_plugins` file has already been installed on the
system.

This only needs to be run once, and should not be bootstrapped in
`config.fish`.
