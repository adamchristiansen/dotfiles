# Fish Shell

## Package Manager

Install [Fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher) using:

```curl
curl -sL https://git.io/fisher | source && fisher update
```

This assumes that the `fish_plugins` file has already been installed on the
system.

This only needs to be run once, and should not be bootstrapped in
`config.fish`.
